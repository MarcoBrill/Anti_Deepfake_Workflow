# Anti-Deepfake Workflow with Liveness Detection and Anti-Forgery Measures

This repository contains a Python script for detecting deepfakes, ensuring liveness, and applying anti-forgery measures using modern computer vision techniques.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Uses MediaPipe for real-time face detection.
- **Liveness Detection**: Predicts whether the detected face is live or spoofed.
- **Deepfake Detection**: Detects if the face is a deepfake.
- **Anti-Forgery Measures**: Implements basic checks for tampering or spoofing.

## Inputs and Outputs
Inputs:
Video file or webcam stream.
Pre-trained models for liveness and deepfake detection.

Outputs:
Real-time video with annotations indicating liveness, deepfake, and anti-forgery results.
Console logs for detected issues (e.g., spoofing, deepfakes).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

## **How to Run**
1. Save the script as `anti_deepfake_workflow.py`.
2. Create a `models/` directory and place your pre-trained models (`liveness_model.h5` and `deepfake_detection_model.h5`) inside it.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anti-deepfake-workflow.git
   cd anti-deepfake-workflow
